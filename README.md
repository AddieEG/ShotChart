# ShotChat

## NBA Shot Chart and Shot Viz

### IST 256 Final Project

May 2022, Freshman Year

## Goal

Create a shot chart for a chosen active player or team.

Add different statistical visualizations.
## Output

I used interact_manual to create a personalized option.

I was interested in learning where a player shoots the ball from the most, so I added a most common shot type bar chart.

This is the output when choosing a player.

Output when choosing team.

In the process, I wanted to add more to the team stats, so I created different stat vizualizations.

## Next Steps

I plan on adding more in the future, but for now, this is what I was able to create for my final project.
